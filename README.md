### Description

- In order to recommend a restaurant or a meal the system needs to take user inputs
from many ways. These inputs apply for both restaurants and meals. This will explain
how we can use those user inputs to recommend a restaurant and the same can be
applied to a meal. User recommends / not recommends, rating on a restaurant and
finally reviews on a restaurant are the user inputs. In this system provides facility to
rate a restaurant scale one to five. Based on the user experience can rate the
restaurant. Collect the information about the restaurant from all the user ratings and
calculate the final rating. Based on the final rating user can decide which meal is
the best.
